In this project, we compare the abilities of ARD ker-nel, Gibbs kernel, additive GPR and a weighted mix-ture of GPs method in handling multiscale features using synthetic data. Application to real data is shownfor some time-series data of fish-catch, and sea-surface-temperature image marred due to cloud cover.
